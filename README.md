# Welcome to Consolesoft-Mirror

This is mirror of source codes, executables and explanatory texts taken from the [original ConsoleSoft by Carlos Montiers](https://web.archive.org/web/http://consolesoft.com/).

The only reason I have created this project is closing of the original one. As Carlos wrote at [DosTips forum](https://www.dostips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=8813):

  _I've been away from batch programming for some time. <...> I will not continue publishing or maintaining the site, because that's the way it has been during the last time._

Any source files are stored under projects' `*/src` directories as is, without changes. Executables can be found as [Release archives](https://github.com/carlos-montiers/consolesoft-mirror/releases). Explanatory texts are adapted for publishing as GitHub README files.

This site is for publish open source code or software.
