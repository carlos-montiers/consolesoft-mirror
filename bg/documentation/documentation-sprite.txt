SPRITE v2.3.1 (unicode)

SPRITE.EXE is a tool for draw on the console screen a sprite file
created with EDITOR.EXE
The row and column are the coordinates of the screen where begin to draw.
That indexes begin in 0, but also you can specify negative values like -1, -2,
for specify begin outside the visible area.

row column fileName [...]
Draw the sprite file on the screen coords: row, column.
The file of the sprite was created using the editor.

Note: Since version 2.0 sprite.exe uses a buffer.
Thus, after draw all .spr files into the buffer,
it draws the content of the buffer on the screen at once.

Sprite read only visible screen buffer rectangle
instead all screen buffer (csbi.dwSize)
For example:
From a screen buffer of 80x300 we read only the window rectangle than can be 80x39
