{Sprite} Editor v1.0.1 (unicode)

EDITOR.EXE is a tool for create sprites for draw with SPRITE.EXE

EDITOR create filename width eight
EDITOR alter filename

The width must be from 1 to 120.
The eight must be from 1 to 60.

For example:
editor create mydraw.spr 11 8
That will create a paint zone of 11x8 and when you save it the data would be on mydraw.spr

editor alter mydraw.spr
That will open the file mydraw.spr and you can edit it.

The first column area is the color of background, the second column are is the color of foreground.
You need select a background color, a foreground color and a symbol from the palette and clic on the paint zone.
X means transparent.
In the paint zone, do a secondary mouse clic and the cell will be transparent.

For save and quit, do a secondary mouse clic outside the paint zone.


About the format of the saved file. Is this in little endian:
2 bytes (SHORT) width
2 bytes (SHORT) eight
4 bytes (CHAR_INFO): 2 bytes unicode char, 2 bytes attributes
...more (CHAR_INFO)

About the transparency: is used the 0 unicode char.
When sprite read it, use the character that is on the screen.
